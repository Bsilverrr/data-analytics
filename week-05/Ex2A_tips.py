# Define known values
food_cost = 79.25
tax = 6.54
tip = 12.00

# Calculate the unknown
total_due = food_cost + tax + tip

# Display the results
 # print("The total due is " + str(total_due))
# str() converts total_due from a float to a string. Python won't join a
# string and a number with +. The number has to be converted first.

print("Food cost is " + str(food_cost) + " and tax is " + str(tax))
# print("Tip is " + str(tip))
print("Total due is " + str(total_due))
print("Tip is " + format(tip, ".2f"))
